The Company

Consider a well-established company operating in the retail food sector. Presently they have around several hundred thousands of registered customers and serve almost one million consumers a year. They sell products from 5 major categories: wines, rare meat products, exotic fruits, specially prepared fish and sweet products. These can further be divided into gold and regular products. The customers can order and acquire products through 3 sales channels: physical stores, catalogs and company’s website. Globally, the company had solid revenues and a healthy bottom line in the past 3 years, but the profit growth perspectives for the next 3 years are not promising... For this reason, several strategic initiatives are being considered to invert this situation. One is to improve the performance of marketing activities, with a special focus on marketing campaigns.
