The Company

Consider a well-established company operating in the retail food sector. Presently they have around several hundred thousands of registered customers and serve almost one million consumers a year. They sell products from 5 major categories: wines, rare meat products, exotic fruits, specially prepared fish and sweet products. These can further be divided into gold and regular products. The customers can order and acquire products through 3 sales channels: physical stores, catalogs and company’s website. Globally, the company had solid revenues and a healthy bottom line in the past 3 years, but the profit growth perspectives for the next 3 years are not promising... For this reason, several strategic initiatives are being considered to invert this situation. One is to improve the performance of marketing activities, with a special focus on marketing campaigns.

The Marketing Department The marketing department was pressured to spend its annual budget more wisely. Desirably, the success of these activities will prove the value of the approach and convince the more skeptical within the company.

Key findings and project takeaway:

1. Age: 30-70 were spending more money, but less likely to accept more campaigns. They do have higher volume
  We can focus on this segment to get them to buy more or accept campaigns

2. Catalogs were more likely to accept campgaigns, but in person spend more. Reccomend a split between them all for campagins. 
push a higher margin for campaigns to catalogs so perhaps --> 40% catalog, 30% web, 30% stores

3. The more kids you have the less campaigns they are accepting and less they are spending
focus on people with no kids since they spend more and accept more campaigns

4. Education has no impact on campaigns or purchases, dont target any segment on groups

5. Marital status doesnt playa big part in campaigns accepted since percentages are similar, but Married, Single, and Together spend more money 

  Key Value and revenue driving recommendations:

1.	Increasing pull from current customers
-	Target middle aged, high earners with no kids
-	Target them on different platforms with campaigns primarily going to catalogs and split the rest of the campaigns evenly to online and the store
  
2.	Find new customers
-	Can also try to target new customers since data only deals with recurring customers
-	Focus on ages 21-30 and 70 and up since they are lower populations compared to other segments
-	These age segments accept campaigns at higher rates
