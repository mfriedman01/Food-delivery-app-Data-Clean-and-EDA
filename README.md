# Food-delivery-app-Data-Clean-and-EDA

Project Background:


Consider a well-established company operating in the retail food sector. Presently they have around several hundred thousands of registered customers and serve almost one million consumers a year. There are 3 channels for purchases: physical stores, catalogs and companyâ€™s website. 


Project Purpose:
1. Retain customer engagment
2. How to grow customer base
3. How to increase current customer spending



Key Objectives:

1. Clean and perform exploratory data analysis on data;
2. Propose and describe a customer segmentation based on customers behaviors - Find key demographics to focus on;
3. Visualize data and provide written reasoning behind discoveries - Find where Company can is either failing or succeeding ;



Key Insights

1. Age: 30-70 were spending more money, but less likely to accept more campaigns. They do have higher volume
  We can focus on this segment to get them to buy more or accept campaigns

2. Catalogs were more likely to accept campgaigns, but in person spend more. Reccomend a split between them all for campagins. 
push a higher margin for campaigns to catalogs so perhaps --> 40% catalog, 30% web, 30% stores

3. The more kids you have the less campaigns they are accepting and less they are spending
focus on people with no kids since they spend more and accept more campaigns

4. Education has no impact on campaigns or purchases, dont target any segment on groups

5. Marital status doesnt play a big part in campaigns accepted since percentages are similar, but Married, Single, and Together spend more money 

  Recommendations:

1.	Increasing pull from current customers
-	Target middle aged, high earners with no kids
-	Target them on different platforms with campaigns primarily going to catalogs and split the rest of the campaigns evenly to online and the store
  
2.	Find new customers
-	Can also try to target new customers since data only deals with recurring customers
-	Focus on ages 21-30 and 70 and up since they are lower populations compared to other segments
-	These age segments accept campaigns at higher rates
